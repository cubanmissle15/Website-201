                        <p>As a Student-athlete I feel that I do not have the time to focus on both schools, Athletics, and still be able to hold a full-time job or internship. However, because of school and Athletics, I feel that I am certified to have multiple skills. I will go into detail as to how my experience allows me to have these skills. </p>
                        <p>Baseball - <br>
                            I have played baseball since I was 8 years old I have achieved multiple high school achievements as well as become a division one baseball player. I believe because of my experience I know to show this skill. 
                            </p>
                        <p>
                            Strength Coach - <br>
                            Although I am not certified to be a legal strength coach. My older sister is a Professional Body Builder with certification to be a strength coach. I have always been surrounded by great coaches, in baseball, and at home with my sister. I believe that this knowledge always me to be able to give other athletes a workout regime that can help them become stronger and overall better athletes. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finance - <br>
                            As a finance student, I believe that over the three years of school I have acquired a significant amount of knowledge in personal finance where I can help individuals calculate their expenses and manage a budget. This knowledge makes me a credible source for personal finances. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Excel word PowerPoint - <br>
                            While being enrolled in college I have taken multiple courses on how to properly use Excel, Word, and PowerPoint. I believe that with the knowledge I have gathered from these classes I can construct projects for small businesses depending on their circumstances. This allows me to be a teacher of this skill. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Spanish Translator - <br>
                            Growing up Spanish was my first language because of this I am fluent in Spanish and English. In high school, I took AP Spanish and passed the course. I can read, write and speak both English and Spanish. I believe that this allows me to be qualified as a translator. 
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Analytics - <br>
                        Growing up playing baseball I became an individual who loves to break down numbers and is very analytical about every move I make. In addition to this in High school, I took multiple analytics classes. This class taught me about the stock market and how to do basic trend lines to follow the company. In addition at UNLV, I took a casino class that taught me about the analytics of the casino floor and the games played there. With this experience, I feel that I am certified to have this skill.
